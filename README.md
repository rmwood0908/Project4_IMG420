# Midnight Snack

This Project #4 is a basis for a game I am going to continue to work on. In this game you play as a Vampire that just woke up at the late hour of 3:00 in the afternoon and you are THIRSTY. However the vampire lives in a castle designed by his own ego with 13 stories, 53 bedrooms, 24 bathrooms, a bowling alley, a full size movie theater, and a 2 car garage. The only problem? there is only one kitchen on the bottom floor. Help the vampire get down to the kichen get his drink and go back up to bed before the moon comes up and he has to go back to work.
